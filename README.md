# Asteroids

Yes, this used to be called Dodge Lines

This project was a concept i always wanted to make since i got into programing on scratch
this was made in python with pygame

You are the red square, dodge everything
the mini square encourages movement, because if it catches up, it will damage you
there are more bouncers the longer you survive
there are powerups to collect the longer you make it
also play it on web!
