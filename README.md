# Asteroids

# History
Yes, this used to be called Dodge Lines

# Backstory/Why I made this
This project was a concept i always wanted to make since i got into programing on scratch
This was made in python with pygame
I learned pygame in 2 days and then decided to make this game

# How to play
You are the red square, dodge everything
the mini square encourages movement, because if it catches up, it will damage you
there are more bouncers the longer you survive
there are powerups to collect the longer you make it

# Web version
also play it on web!
